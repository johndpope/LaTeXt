LaTeXt
==============

LaTeXt is an iOS 8 app with a keyboard extension that allows users to 
type LaTeX equations in casual conversations with live compiled-equation viewing.

As math and science majors tired of texting markup to our friends, we've always 
thought: "there has to be a better way." So, we created LaTeXt to allow college students
and aspiring young scientists to easily communicate their mathematical ideas with their
friends and colleagues using their iPhones.

The main features of LaTeXt are:

- Live Compilation and Preview of Typed LaTeX Equations

- Full Symbolic Math Keyboard with common operators like sums and integrals, and the keyboard accessible from any text application

- Capability to send images of complied equations to recipients though iMessage

- Capability to send mixed text and equations in one single message to other app users

- Push notification of received equations (using Microsoft Azure Mobile Service)

- History view of all messages received (using Microsoft Azure Mobile Service)

The iOS app code is at DJBen's repository [here](https://github.com/DJBen/YHack2014Fall)
